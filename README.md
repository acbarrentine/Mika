# Mika
A simple script compiler and runtime virtual machine for game engines. This is intended for instructional purposes. You are, however, free to use it as you see fit. If you do make use of this system, I would appreciate a heads up on Twitter @acbarrentine.

Mika makes use of 3 other open source components.
* Winflex, the Windows version of the Flex lexer generator component.
* Catch.hpp, the single-file unit testing frameworks
* Irrlicht, an open source game engine. This is not distributed with Mika, but the MikaWorld example project expects to be able to link against it.

Each of these has their own open source licenses, reproduced here. See each for its own distribution technicalities.

For those curious, Mika is named after a particularly sassy Siberian Husky my best friend has. She is in charge of everything, and she knows it! I named this project after her to do honor to a wonderful dog.
